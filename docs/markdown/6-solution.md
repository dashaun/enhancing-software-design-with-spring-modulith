Start with the guardrails.

Notes:
- Feels strange at first
- But, think of the "menu" for AWS
- Look at CNCF landscape
- even Spring Initializr
- There are a lot of choices to make, before we even start
- What if the supported stack includes
- Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Minio
- New teammate has Oracle, Dapr, ActiveMQ
- and love hexagonal architecture, ports and adapters

- Verifications / structural validation tests
- Documentation
- Event Driven Architecture
