### Monoliths are hard to test

### Testing Slices

- @DataJpaTest
- @WebMvcTest
- @JdbcTest
- @DataMongoTest
- @JsonTest
- @RestClientTest

Notes:
- Slices are awesome
- write tests for specific parts of your application
- in isolation
- without bootstrapping the whole Spring Context

---

### @ApplicationModuleTest

### Even with tests, what does the architecture look like?

---

### Documenting

Test Driven Documentation is the other TDD

Notes:
- Spring REST docs (OpenAPI)
- Documentation driving the code

---

### Demo

- Docs
- UML
