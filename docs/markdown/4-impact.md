## Spring CLI

- A catalog of "modules"
- Supported examples
- Latest conventions
- Easy onboarding

Notes:
- The easy thing to do
- The guardrails
- More than initializr
- Includes sample code

---

```text
spring project-catalog add --name juice --url https://github.com/dashaun-project-catalog/project-catalog
```
> Add the catalog that contains our conventions

---

```text
spring project list
```
> Whats' on the menu?

Notes:
- First concept
- Whats on the menu
- Each team can have their own catalog
- Their own supported patterns

spring boot new modulith-demo modulith
```
> I'll have the Modulith, please.
