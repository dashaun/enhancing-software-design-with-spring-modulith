### Modulith?

Modular monoliths

Notes:
- are a new way to organize and evolve software projects.
- They are a hybrid approach
- combines the benefits of microservices
- with the simplicity of monolithic architectures. 
- Moduliths are designed to be highly modular,
- with each module encapsulating a specific set of functionality.
- This makes it easier to reason about the codebase, maintain and evolve the software,
- and scale the application as needed.

- Inventory and Orders
- Inventory depends on Orders

### Defining and managing logical modules

---

## Utilizing Spring Modulith tools for structural validation tests

ensuring each component functions correctly and cohesively

---

## Documenting the architecture of your application

facilitating better collaboration and future modifications

---

## Implementing interactions between modules in a way that maintains their independence

yet allows for effective communication

---

## Monitoring real-time interactions between modules during the software's operation
