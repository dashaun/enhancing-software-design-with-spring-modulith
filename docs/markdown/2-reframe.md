- "How do I get my team to write better code?"
- "What are the best practices?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- By far the most popular questions I get in this role
- It has to be more than just what are the best practices.
- How do you DELIVER the best practices?

---

### Best practices change over time.

---

#### Best practices are not enough.

---

### Spring Modulith provides a way to validate best practices.

Josh mentioned the bad practices that we have seen in the past. (Ruby on Rails)

# Demo
