- My children will never deploy active-passive
- The speed of business is accelerating

- "How do I get my team to write better code?"
- "What are the best practices?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- New teammate has Oracle, Dapr, ActiveMQ
- and love hexagonal architecture, ports and adapters
