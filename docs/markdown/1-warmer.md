## What are you building?

- Enterprise Application aRchive (EAR)
- Microservices are bootiful
- Containers are the new artifact

Notes:
- Microservices allowed me to get to production faster
- API provided a contract
- Make Jar not War
- API allowed for multiple teams to work in parallel

---

- Sometimes, with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
- Sometimes, with Spring Boot, everything looks like microservices.

Notes:
- Having more tools in your tool belt
- and knowing when to use each one
- is a crucial aspect of modern design and architecture.

### Spring Boot

- Auto-configuration
- Abstractions and conventions
- Release trains
- Joyful developing
- Cloud native
- Enterprise-grade
- Production ready

Notes:
- When you think about Spring Boot

What if I told you
that you can have even more joy
on your path to production
with Spring Boot?
