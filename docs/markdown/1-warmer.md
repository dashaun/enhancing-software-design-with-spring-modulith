## What are you building?

- Enterprise Application aRchive (EAR)
- Microservices are bootiful
- Containers are the new artifact

Notes:
- I hope its not EAR files
- I'm no longer surprised by how teams get to production
- Have you moved to or beyond
- Make Jar not War
- If I say "Containers are the new artifact"

- Sometimes, with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
- Sometimes, with Spring Boot, everything looks like microservices.

Notes:
- With Spring Boot, every problem started to look like a microservice
- I have a default pattern
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Spring Authorization Server
- Spring Session with Redis
- Spring Cloud Config, Eureka
- Spring REST Docs
- Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana
- Spring Boot Maven Plugin, Buildpacks
- Native Images so I can deploy to Raspberry Pi devices

### Spring Boot

- Auto-configuration
- Abstractions and conventions
- Release trains
- Joyful developing
- Cloud native
- Enterprise-grade
- Production ready

Notes:
- When you think about Spring Boot

---

What if I told you
that you can have even more joy
on your path to production
with Spring Boot?

Notes:
- So many benefits and strengths here
- We've had so much success
- We've seen it work
- Let's do it again, the same way

### Having the right tools in your tool belt, and knowing when to use each one, is a crucial aspect of modern design and architecture.

Notes:
- Do you have the right tools in your tool belt?
- Do you know when, and how, to use them?
- Are you sure?
